Okay, so I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness and oh man, I’m in a glass case of emotion, LOL. Like, I mean, the whole idea that love conquers all—even in the darkest times, I find that kinda hilariously naive and profoundly touching all at once, you know?

I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it thinking, How many times can they show someone gazing into the distance, pondering love, without me rolling my eyes right outta my head? Apparently, a lot! And yet, here I am feeling oddly uplifted. I swear I didn't cry, okay? Okay, maybe a little. 

You ever just want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie so you can replay the scenes and catch all the tiny details you missed? Like, the cinematography was top-notch, and every tear-soaked moment felt so damn epic. Sidebar: why is every dramatic moment in movies now accompanied by strings and pianos? I mean, c’mon, switch it up a bit.

> Have you had that feeling where you're super into what's happening onscreen, but also mildly aware that maybe it's all a bit too saccharine? Seriously, the dialogue at some points felt like it was pulled straight from a Hallmark card, but somehow it works? 

I think I’m gonna have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie again when I’m not half asleep. There was this bit about love being like a guiding light, and I was like, Hey, maybe they should start teaching this stuff in history classes?” Imagine the assignments, “write an essay on how love changed the course of medieval politics,” haha!

document.getElementById('love').innerHTML = 'No darkness';

Anyway, I should probably crash soon, or I'm gonna look and feel like a zombie at work tomorrow. Got essays about Napoleon’s... napoleonic ways waiting for me, ugh.
